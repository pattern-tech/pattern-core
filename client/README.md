# Pattern Core Client

## Installation

Ensure you have Node.js version 20 or higher installed.

We recommend using `pnpm`. If you haven't installed `pnpm`, install it globally using:

```sh
npm i -g pnpm
```

To install dependencies, run:

```sh
pnpm install
```

## Running the Application

### Local Development

To start the application in development mode, run:

```sh
pnpm run dev
```

### Production

To build the application for production, run:

```sh
pnpm run build
```

After building, you need to serve the build output using a suitable server.
